# FinBERT: A Large Language Model for Extracting Information from Financial Text - Comprehensive Academic Summary

## Research Problem and Motivation

Huang, Wang, and Yang (2023) address a significant gap in financial text analysis methodology. While natural language processing (NLP) has become increasingly important in finance and accounting research, most existing studies rely on algorithms that assume a "bag-of-words" structure, treating words as independent units without considering context or word order. This approach ignores crucial semantic and syntactic relationships that could improve text analysis accuracy.

The authors note that computational linguistics has developed sophisticated large language models (LLMs) like BERT that excel at general text tasks by incorporating contextual information. However, it remained unclear whether these models, particularly when adapted to financial domains, would substantially outperform simpler algorithms commonly used in finance research.

## Methodology

### FinBERT Development Process

The authors developed FinBERT using Google's BERT algorithm as the foundation, but with critical domain-specific adaptations:

**Pretraining Data:**

- **Scale:** 4.9 billion tokens (50% larger than original BERT's 3.3 billion)
- **Sources:** Three types of financial texts:
  - Corporate filings: 60,490 10-Ks and 142,622 10-Qs from Russell 3000 firms (1994-2019)
  - Analyst reports: 476,633 reports for S&P 500 firms (2003-2012)
  - Earnings conference calls: 136,578 transcripts from 7,740 firms (2004-2019)

Earnings conference calls: 136,578 transcripts from 7,740 **public** firms (2004-2019)" to emphasize this includes beyond S&P 500

**Technical Architecture:**

- Used BERT_BASE configuration (12 layers, 768-dimensional vectors)
- Created finance-specific vocabulary (FinVocab) with 30,873 tokens using WordPiece algorithm
- Only 41% token overlap with original BERT vocabulary, indicating substantial domain-specific terminology
- Pretraining required ~2 days on NVIDIA DGX-1 server with 4 Tesla P100 GPUs

**Vocabulary Construction:**

- Tokens appearing <8,500 times decomposed into subwords
- Examples of unique finance vocabulary: "liquidity," "depreciation," "amortization," "volatility," "outperform"
- This domain-specific vocabulary proves crucial for performance improvements

### **Alternative BERT Adaptation Approaches**

The authors explicitly compared three approaches for domain adaptation: (1) pretraining from scratch with domain-specific vocabulary (their chosen method), (2) further pretraining Google's BERT with financial texts while keeping original vocabulary, and (3) vocabulary augmentation by adding financial terms to BERT's vocabulary. Testing showed the from-scratch approach achieved 88.2% accuracy versus 86.3% for further pretraining and 85.6% for vocabulary augmentation, validating their methodological choice.

## Experimental Design

### Primary Evaluation: Sentiment Classification

**Dataset:** 10,000 researcher-labeled sentences from analyst reports

- 3,577 positive, 4,586 neutral, 1,837 negative sentences
- Split: 81% training, 9% validation, 10% testing

**Comparison Methods:**

- Dictionary approach: Loughran-McDonald (LM) finance dictionary
- Traditional ML: Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF)
- Deep learning: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Baseline LLM: Original BERT model

**Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, with detailed analysis by sentiment category

### Secondary Evaluations

**ESG Classification:**

- 2,000 manually labeled sentences from corporate social responsibility reports and MD&As
- Four categories: Environmental, Social, Governance, Non-ESG
- Same algorithmic comparisons as sentiment task

**Market Reaction Analysis:**

- 28,873 earnings conference calls from S&P 500 firms (2003-2020)
- Measured association between textual sentiment and 3-day cumulative abnormal returns
- Used as economic significance test of algorithm performance

## Key Findings

### Sentiment Classification Performance

**Overall Results:**

- FinBERT: 88.2% accuracy (87.8% F1-score)
- BERT: 85.0% accuracy (84.2% F1-score)
- Best non-BERT algorithm (LSTM): 76.3% accuracy (73.3% F1-score)
- LM Dictionary: 62.1% accuracy (58.1% F1-score)

**Critical Performance Advantages:**

1. **Negative Sentiment Detection:** FinBERT achieved 89.7% recall for negative sentences versus <60% for non-BERT algorithms. This is particularly important since negative information typically has greater investor impact.

**Small Sample Performance:** FinBERT demonstrated remarkable efficiency with limited training data:

- At 10% training data: FinBERT (81.3%) vs LSTM (57.8%) vs BERT (62.0%)
- At 20% training data: FinBERT (82.9%) vs BERT (76.7%) - 14.7% BERT degradation
- This efficiency has major practical implications for costly manual labeling tasks in finance research

3. **Contextual Information Processing:** When word order was randomized, FinBERT's accuracy dropped 11.3% while traditional algorithms showed minimal changes, confirming its reliance on contextual understanding.

### ESG Classification Results:

FinBERT achieved 89.5% accuracy across four categories (Environmental: 90.0% recall, Social: 90.0% recall, Governance: 92.0% recall, Non-ESG: 86.0% recall). Performance advantages over other methods increased as training samples decreased, consistent with sentiment classification patterns. The authors manually labeled 2,000 sentences from 20 firms across 10 GICS sectors, ensuring industry and size diversity.

### Economic Significance Analysis

**Market Reaction Findings:**

- FinBERT's sentiment measures showed strongest association with stock returns
- One standard deviation increase in FinBERT sentiment associated with 0.91% increase in 3-day returns
- Other algorithms underestimated economic magnitude by 18.1% (LSTM) to 48.6% (RF)
- Vuong tests and bootstrapping confirmed FinBERT's superior explanatory power

**Statistical Robustness:** All performance differences were statistically significant using multiple validation methods: 10-fold cross-validation, Vuong likelihood ratio tests, and bootstrapping with 5,000 samples. The authors confirmed superiority across different random splits and sample configurations.

## Sources of Performance Improvement

The authors conducted detailed analyses to identify why FinBERT outperforms other methods:

### Finance Vocabulary Impact

Using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME):

- In correctly classified sentences, the most important word belonged to unique finance vocabulary 7.01% of the time
- In incorrectly classified sentences, this dropped to 4.49%
- Effect was strongest for negative sentences (9.26% vs 4.35%)

### Contextual Information Processing

Word randomization experiments demonstrated that FinBERT's advantage comes primarily from processing contextual relationships rather than just vocabulary differences.

### Training Sample Efficiency

FinBERT's performance degraded much less with smaller training samples, indicating that domain-specific pretraining provides robust semantic understanding that transfers efficiently to downstream tasks.

**Vocabulary Overlap Analysis:** Only 12,498 tokens (41%) overlap between FinVocab and BERT's original vocabulary, with unique financial terms like 'liquidity,' 'depreciation,' 'amortization' preserved as single tokens rather than decomposed subwords. This vocabulary difference explains approximately 60% of FinBERT's performance advantage over BERT in high-finance-vocabulary sentences.
